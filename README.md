# Catalyst Center Port Control Utility

This Python utility communicates with Cisco **Catalyst Center** to perform administrative actions on network switch ports based on a clientâ€™s MAC address.

---

## What It Does

- Looks up a client using its MAC address via Catalyst Center APIs
- Identifies the connected **switch and interface port**
- Allows administrative **enabling or disabling of the switch port** (e.g., shut/no shut)

---

## Use Case

Designed for network operations teams or security personnel who need a **quick-response tool** to isolate endpoints (e.g., malware-infected hosts or rogue devices).

> **Note:** While Cisco Adaptive Network Control (ANC) provides a more robust policy-based approach, this script offers an alternative.

---

## Warning: Use With Caution

This tool modifies live **switch interface configuration** (enabling/disabling ports).  
**Double-check the MAC address and confirm the target before applying changes.**

You are responsible for verifying that your usage complies with your organization's change control policies.

## Cisco Catalyst Center APIs Used

- `GET /dna/intent/api/v1/client-detail?macAddress=<mac_address>`  
- `GET /dna/intent/api/v1/interface/network-device/<switch_uuid>/interface-name?name=<switch_port>`  
- `PUT /dna/intent/api/v1/interface/<switch_port_uuid>?deploymentMode=Deploy`  
- `GET /api/v1/task/<task_id>`

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python >=3.13 with requests & dotenv packages
- Cisco Catalyst Center instance with API access enabled (script is tested on 2.3.7.10)
- API user credentials with permission to:
  - Query clients and devices
  - Modify interface state
